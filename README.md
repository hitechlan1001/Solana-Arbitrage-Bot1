# Solana Arbitrage Bot – Real Profitable, Not Theory  

## Overview
A high-performance arbitrage bot for Solana that monitors Raydium DEX price movements and executes profitable trades automatically. Unlike theory-focused repos, this project provides real proof of profitability through demo videos, transaction screenshots, and on-chain explorer links.

The bot continuously scans Raydium pools (AMM, CLMM, CPMM) to detect price inefficiencies and performs arbitrage with optimized speed and reliability. Built for practical results, it leverages real-time transaction monitoring to identify and capture profitable opportunities within the Solana DeFi ecosystem.

* Most repos show you *endless theory, sample code, or simulations*.  
This one is different.  

### I don’t like theory. I like practice.  
That’s why instead of publishing source code, I’ve attached:  

- ✔ **Working demo video** of the bot in action.  
- ✔ **Transaction screenshots & explorer links** proving live profitable trades.  
- ✔ **Transactions shown in video**.  
- ✔ **Private repo screenshot** (showing the real project exists, but stays private).  

No gimmicks, no empty repositories — just proof that this bot is **real and profitable**.
