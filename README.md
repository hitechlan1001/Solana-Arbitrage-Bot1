# Solana Arbitrage Bot – Real Profitable, Not Just Theory  

Most repos show you *endless theory, sample code, or simulations*.  
This one is different.  

### I don’t like theory. I like practice.  
That’s why instead of publishing source code, I’ve attached:  

- ✔ **Working demo video** of the bot in action.  
- ✔ **Transaction screenshots & explorer links** proving live profitable trades.  
- ✔ **Transactions shown in video**.  
- ✔ **Private repo screenshot** (showing the real project exists, but stays private).  

No gimmicks, no empty repositories — just proof that this bot is **real and profitable**.
